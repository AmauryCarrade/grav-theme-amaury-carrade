# Nebulius Theme

**Nebulius** theme for the [Grav CMS](http://github.com/getgrav/grav).

This theme is developed for the nebulius.org website. It is not intended for other uses; this said, it is published under a free software licence (CeCILL-B) so it can be reused if needed.

You can see a demo at [the Nebulius website](https://nebulius.org).

SASS is required to build this theme, if you want to change it. Use the Makefile to compile or watch for SCSS files changes. If you only want to use the template, this is not required, as compiled files are in the repository alongside SCSS files.
